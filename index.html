    <h1>Plastic Waste and Freshwater Pollution in Vijayawada</h1>
    <p>An assessment for spreading awareness on the impact of plastic waste on freshwater ecosystems in Vijayawada due to human activities </p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Freshwater ecosystems in urban areas are increasingly threatened by human activities, particularly the improper disposal of plastic waste. In Vijayawada, a rapidly growing city in Andhra Pradesh, India, the Krishna River faces significant environmental pressure due to unregulated solid waste management. This report explores the impact of plastic pollution on freshwater ecosystems, focusing on microplastics, chemical contamination, and the resulting ecological consequences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Research Question</h2>
      <p>To what extent does improper plastic waste disposal contribute to freshwater pollution in Vijayawada, and what are its ecological and public health implications?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Microplastics</h2>
      <p>Plastic debris that enters freshwater systems does not naturally biodegrade and breaks down into microplastics through processes such as photodegradation, mechanical abrasion, and hydrolysis. Studies show that the Krishna River contains polymers like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Recent 2025 monitoring data report microplastic concentrations of up to 100 particles per litre in urban-impacted areas, posing risks of ingestion for aquatic organisms and potential transfer through the food chain to humans (Singh et al., 2025; Krishna River Water Quality Survey, 2025).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Chemical Contamination and Bioaccumulation</h2>
      <p>Microplastics can carry chemical pollutants by adsorbing heavy metals, such as lead and cadmium, as well as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from the water. Fish sampled from the Krishna River have been found with cadmium levels exceeding WHO guidelines, indicating notable bioaccumulation within the aquatic food chain. Prolonged exposure could lead to biomagnification of these toxins in humans, raising serious public health concerns (WHO, 2024; Kumar et al., 2025).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Ecological and Infrastructure Impacts</h2>
      <p>Declines in important aquatic organisms, such as micro-crustaceans, indicate worsening water quality. Accumulated plastic waste in drainage systems has previously contributed to urban flooding, particularly in September 2024. Additionally, plastic deposited upstream accelerates sedimentation and changes deltaic morphodynamics, potentially impacting flood control and local agriculture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Environmental, Health, and Socioeconomic Consequences of Plastic Pollution</h2>
      <p>Plastic pollution in freshwater ecosystems has far-reaching ecological, chemical, and socio-economic consequences. Ecologically, the accumulation of plastics and microplastics disrupts aquatic habitats and leads to the decline of sensitive organisms, such as micro-crustaceans, small fish, and insects, which serve as key components of the food chain. Ingestion of microplastics by these organisms results in bioaccumulation of chemical pollutants, including heavy metals like cadmium and lead, as well as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This chemical accumulation can then biomagnify through the food chain, posing significant health risks to humans who consume contaminated fish, potentially affecting neurological, renal, and developmental health. Moreover, the presence of plastic waste in drainage systems and rivers contributes to physical habitat alterations, blocks water flow, and has caused urban flooding in Vijayawada, such as the event in September 2024. Upstream plastic deposition also accelerates sedimentation and modifies deltaic morphodynamics, potentially impacting flood management and agricultural productivity. Socioeconomically, declining fish populations threaten local fisheries and the livelihoods of communities dependent on freshwater resources, while deteriorating water quality reduces the availability of clean water for domestic and agricultural use. Together, these consequences underscore the urgent need for integrated waste management, policy enforcement, and community awareness initiatives to mitigate environmental degradation and public health risks. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The improper disposal of plastic waste is a major contributor to freshwater pollution in Vijayawada. The widespread presence of microplastics, chemical bioaccumulation, and ecological disturbances underscores the urgent need for integrated waste management strategies, stricter policy enforcement, and community awareness programs to reduce environmental and public health risks.</p>
